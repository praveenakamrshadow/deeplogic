       <p className="con" style={{fontWeight:"700"}}>Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, is a key component of offensive security. The idea is to simulate a cyberattack on an organization's infrastructure to uncover vulnerabilities before actual hackers do. Here are some types of penetration testing:</p>
       <p className="con">1.<b> Network Penetration Testing </b> : This involves testing the security of the organization's network, including servers, network devices, and other network endpoints. It could also involve simulating a network-based ransomware attack to understand its impact.</p>
       <p className="con">2.<b> Web Application Penetration Testing </b> : This type of penetration testing involves exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, which are typically one of the most frequently attacked components of an organization's infrastructure.</p>
       <p className="con">3.<b> Mobile Application Penetration Testing </b> : As more organizations depend on mobile applications, testing the security of these applications has become vital. This might involve exploiting weaknesses in APIs, session management, or data storage. </p>
       <p className="con">4.<b> Wireless Penetration Testing </b> : With the proliferation of IoT devices and increased reliance on wireless connections, ensuring the security of wireless networks is crucial. This involves testing wireless encryption, device isolation, and other security protocols.</p>
       <p className="con">5.<b> Social Engineering Penetration Testing </b> : Often, the weakest link in an organization's security is the human element. Social engineering penetration tests aim to exploit human weaknesses through methods like phishing, baiting, pretexting, etc.</p>
       <p className="con">6.<b> Physical Penetration Testing </b> : This involves attempting unauthorized access to physical devices or hardware within the organization, including servers, workstations, or even access to the building itself.</p>
       <p className="con">7.<b> Cloud Penetration Testing </b> : With the rising trend of cloud computing, securing cloud-based systems and applications has become crucial. This type of testing involves assessing the security of cloud environments, storage, applications, and APIs.</p>
       <p className="con">8.<b> Red Teaming </b> : Red teaming is a more comprehensive form of penetration testing, involving a full-spectrum attack simulation across all systems, often without the knowledge of most of the organization's employees.</p>
       <p className="con">9.<b> Ransomware Simulation </b> :  A newer trend in penetration testing is ransomware simulation, where an ethical hacker simulates a ransomware attack to evaluate the organization's preparedness, resilience, and response strategy. It tests the ability to detect, prevent, and recover from such an attack.</p>
       <p className="con" style={{fontWeight:"500"}}>Remember that these tests must be carried out by authorized professionals and under the full knowledge and agreement of the involved organization to prevent any legal issues. Each type of test can help organizations identify vulnerabilities and take corrective measures before real attackers can exploit them.</p>
