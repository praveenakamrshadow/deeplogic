       <p className="con">1.<b> Network Vulnerability Assessment</b>: This assessment focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in the organization's network infrastructure, including both hardware and software components. Tools like network scanners are used to identify unsecured points of entry.</p>
       <p className="con">2.<b> Application Vulnerability Assessment</b>: This assessment involves checking applications for vulnerabilities that could be exploited. It often involves source code reviews, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing.</p>
       <p className="con">3.<b> Wireless Network Vulnerability Assessment</b>: This type of assessment focuses on the wireless networks of an organization. These networks often have different vulnerabilities than wired networks, including risks associated with unauthorized access and data interception.</p>
       <p className="con">4.<b> Database Vulnerability Assessment</b>:  Databases are critical points of vulnerability as they often hold an organization's most sensitive information. This type of assessment focuses on identifying potential weaknesses in a database's security that could allow for unauthorized data access or manipulation.</p>
       <p className="con">5.<b> Host-Based Vulnerability Assessment</b>: This involves checking the servers or hosts on a network for vulnerabilities. It can include checking the configurations, installing software, patch management, etc.</p>
       <p className="con">6.<b> Physical Vulnerability Assessment</b>: This is often overlooked but it's an important assessment to evaluate the physical security measures in place to protect the organization's hardware and data. It can involve things like assessing access control measures, surveillance systems, and the overall security of physical locations</p>
       <p className="con">7.<b> Cloud-Based Vulnerability Assessment</b>: With the rising use of cloud services, assessing the vulnerabilities in a cloud-based system is important. It includes checking for potential weaknesses in the security of cloud-hosted services and data.</p>
       <p className="con">8.<b> IoT Vulnerability Assessment</b>: With the proliferation of IoT devices, these devices bring a whole new array of potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This type of assessment focuses on identifying and addressing those vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p className='con' style={{fontWeight:"500"}}> The results of these assessments are typically used to prioritize and guide efforts to improve security and to help organizations understand their risk profile and regulatory compliance status.</p>
